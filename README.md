Quantifying the Contribution of NHL Player Positions to Team Performance and How it affects Roster Construction

Kenyon College

Will Gibbs and Parker Gibbons 


Question of Interest: The basic question is: How does each position in hockey (forward, defenseman, and goalie) contribute to a teamâ€™s success in the NHL? NHL teams are faced with a salary cap that impacts how they can construct their roster and so being able to classify different player types and subsequently seeing how each player type contributes to team performance could illuminate how teams can best construct their roster. We would also like to compare if our findings can be generalized to the successful teams in the league or if each team has different thinking behind what positions they think contribute most to team performance.

Methods Used:
- Multiple Linear Regression
- K-means clustering
- Random Forrests
- TOPSIS Method

Dataset: We will get most of our data from https://moneypuck.com/index.html and look at basic performance statistics as well as more advanced statistics. Our response variable will be team points earned over the regular season.
